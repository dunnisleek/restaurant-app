Sigup page explanation on METHODS
The code snippet you provided appears to be a Vue.js component or method. It includes two methods: `addMe` and `signUp`. Here's a breakdown of what each method does:

1. `addMe`: This method logs the `name`, `email`, and `password` properties to the console. It is likely used for debugging or testing purposes.

2. `signUp`: This method performs an asynchronous operation to sign up a user. It sends a POST request to "http://localhost:3000/users" with the user's email, password, and name as the request payload. It uses the `axios` library to make the HTTP request.

   Upon receiving a response from the server, the method checks if the response status is 201 (indicating success). If it is, an alert with the message "signup done" is shown, and the user information is stored in the browser's local storage using `localStorage.setItem`. After that, it redirects the user to the home page using Vue Router's `$router.push` method.

   Note: The `this` keyword is used within a Vue.js component to refer to the component instance, allowing access to its properties and methods.

It's worth mentioning that this code snippet relies on external dependencies like Vue.js and axios. Additionally, the endpoint "http://localhost:3000/users" suggests that it is making a request to a local server running on your machine.

MOUNTED PART ON SIGNUP
The `mounted` lifecycle hook in a Vue.js component is called after the component has been added to the DOM. In this case, the `mounted` hook is used to check if there is user information stored in the browser's local storage.

Here's what the code does:

1. It retrieves the value associated with the key `'user-info'` from the local storage using `localStorage.getItem('user-info')` and assigns it to the `user` variable.

2. It checks if the `user` variable is truthy, which means that there is user information stored in the local storage.

3. If there is user information, it redirects the user to the home page using `this.$router.push('/')`. The `$router.push()` method is part of Vue Router and is used to programmatically navigate to a specific route.

Overall, this code ensures that if there is user information stored in the local storage when the component is mounted, the user is automatically redirected to the home page. This can be useful for implementing authentication logic or handling cases where a user is already logged in.

## Login page explanation
login: This method is responsible for performing an asynchronous login operation. It sends a GET request to "http://localhost:3000/users" with the user's email and password as query parameters. It uses template literals ( ) to dynamically insert the values of this.email and this.password into the URL.

After receiving a response from the server, the method checks if the response status is 200 (indicating success) and if the response data has at least one element (result.data.length > 0). If both conditions are met, it shows an alert with the message "signup done" and stores the first element of the response data (assuming it represents user information) in the browser's local storage using localStorage.setItem. It then redirects the user to the home page using Vue Router's $router.push method.

mounted: This lifecycle hook is executed when the component is mounted on the page. It checks if there is a user information stored in the browser's local storage (localStorage.getItem('user-info')). If there is, it means the user is already logged in, so it redirects them to the home page using Vue Router's $router.push method.

The purpose of this hook is to prevent users from accessing the signup page again if they are already logged in. Instead, they are redirected directly to the home page.

Please note that this code assumes the usage of external dependencies like Vue.js and axios. Additionally, the endpoint "http://localhost:3000/users" suggests that it is making a request to a local server running on your machine.
